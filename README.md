# GoTransit
Simple python script that I have created to fetch and parse the GoTransit schedules for all stations and then display the schedule in a table format
in 12h time because GoTransit uses 24h time and it drives me insane xD

<h3>ToDo</h3>
<li>Update Custom Schedule Mode So The User Does Not Have To Input Direction (N.E.S.W) & Route Number</li>
